🔁 DFS vs Level Order Traversal (LOT)
Feature	DFS (Depth First Search)                                                        	LOT (Level Order Traversal)
Traversal Style	Goes deep down a path (left/right) first	                                Visits nodes level by level
Implementation	Usually recursive (or with a stack)                                       Always uses a queue
Order	Preorder, Inorder, Postorder	                                                      Top to bottom, left to right level-wise
Memory Usage	Depends on tree height (stack space)                                       	Depends on breadth of tree (queue space)
Best For	When we need to explore paths (e.g., root to leaf)                            	When we want shortest path or nodes at a certain level
Example Use Case	Sum root-to-leaf paths,                                                 Binary Tree Paths	Printing nodes level by level, finding min depth
Traversal Output (for tree):	1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 3 → 6 (Preorder DFS)                       	1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 (LOT)
